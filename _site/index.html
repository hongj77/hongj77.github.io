    <p>There are a few key advantages that come with going to an engineering school with a strong reputation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <s>Tons and tons of work.</s>
  </li>
  <li>
    <s>Each semester costs more than $25,000.</s>
  </li>
  <li>???</li>
  <li>Okay, these weren’t really advantages.</li>
</ol>

<p>Joking aside, there are actually a few perks that all (CS) students have access to here at Cornell: tech companies recruit really, really hard. Around the beginning of each semester, companies come and throw events, give talks, and hold competitions in the hopes of becoming at least marginally more noticeable in the absolute <em>chaos</em> that is career fair. Have you ever tried to pass out 30 resumes in 3 hours? Exactly.</p>

<p>In those two weeks, however, you feel like a king. Not many days when someone actually wants to hear about that project you did that one time using Dockers and ECS. Let’s not forget about the free food and swag. Last weekend, I happened to go to a talk by <a href="https://gigster.com/">Gigster</a>, and they had a machine learning workshop, which aimed to cover <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit</a>, <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, and <a href="http://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a> (really cool stuff btw). To jumpstart their recruiting efforts, they had a weekend long machine learning competition, which I assume was to select the best and the brightest candidates at Cornell by looking at who won the ML challenge. Too bad I won by accident.</p>

</div>

<p>You can check out the competition <a href="https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/gigster-ml">here</a>. The task was to predict the opening weekend revenues of major films released in 2008 and 2009, and the evaluation metric was Mean Absolute Error of all your predictions.</p>

<p>I’m going to preface this by saying I really like the data science stuff. When I was first learning ML (CS 4780), I wrote my own <a href="https://github.com/hongj77/coding-practice/tree/master/codingchallenges/naive_bayes">gaussian NB classifier</a> to a SquareSpace coding challenge because I thought it was cool. I got rejected the next morning because apparently I had no idea what I was doing.. But with time, I naturally got more exposure to ML through taking natural language processing, computer vision, and joining a deep learning research lab.</p>

<p>So at this point, I knew enough to be able to have fun with the contest. I thought I would submit one or two different models to see how well they do, but I got completely absored and ended up submitting 35 different solutions. Suddenly, I realized I had no idea what I was doing and just decided to <s>yolo</s> average the result of 2000 different solutions using a random forest.</p>

<p>Besides the few lines for for cross validation and custom evaluation metrics, my entire code at the end of the night boiled down to these 3 lines:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c"># random forest</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sklearn.ensemble</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">RandomForestRegressor</span>
<span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">RandomForestRegressor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n_estimators</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">max_depth</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">y_hat</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X_train</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y_train</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">values</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">flatten</span><span class="p">())</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">predict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">X_test</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next day, my random forest climbed to #1 and the contest ended.</p>

<p>..And just like that, I had robbed Gigster of a drone, a BB-8 toy, and a recruiting opportunity. The guy who won second place apparently was a guy from my research lab (aka he is actually competent). He approached me and asked what I used to jump the rankings, and all I could say was…. random forest.</p>

<p><b>Lesson learned here:</b> machine learning is fickle, I still don’t know machine learning, when in doubt average a bunch of wrong solutions together to get the right solution.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Most of the time, it seems that brilliant realizations come to me only at 3:00AM. As I sit in my college apartment, regretting the time I’ve spent putting together this website, the clock reads 3:17, and I’m starting to question if all ideas naturally seem like great ideas at this hour..</p>

<p>Making a blog was definitely not in my agenda even 5 hours ago, but earlier today, Arpita Ghosh and her Networks homework was easily pushed aside in favor of watching videos on Facebook. Specifically, I saw a weight-loss transformation of a guy who literally ended up losing 200 pounds and turning his life around. At the end, he looked back on what was probably the hardest journey in his entire life and, very understandably, he was emotional about it. Normally, I would be back to scrolling for the next video, but un-understandably(?), I, who is least likely to understand what he went through, felt something click in my head. Somewhere, for some reason, I had the sudden compelling urgency and motivation to break out of habit and actually do <em>something,</em> because god dammit I wanted to change my life too.</p>

<p>This reaction seemed odd since things had been going well recently, but for some time now, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Life is a circus and I’m just jumping through hoops. I was always moving quickly, but the thing with these routines is that you never quite know where you’re going until you see the next hoop. According to <cite>Inside Out</cite>, Life is made up of the accumilations of thousands of tiny decisions that you make everyday. If I’m absorbed in a routine without thinking, then am I really making choices for myself?</p>

<p>As graduation approaches, I am prompted to think more frequently about the career path that I have to make, and all the hoops I’ve jumped through. The big decisions I’ve had to make until now seemed pale in comparison to picking a career that I’ll be pursing until I <strong>die</strong>. If I had to pick a time to stop jumping through hoops, it might as well be now.</p>

<p>So this blog is my little spark of defiance against regularity, old-habits, and hoops. If I know I’m rubbish at writing, then putting up a website with only writing will surely be the most uncomfortable thing for me at this critical junction in life. If this means that I have to continue to write meaningless blog posts to kindle some sort of rebellion, then I will continue doing so, and maybe somewhere down the line, they will eventually become meaningful to me.</p>
